# Single-Cycle MIPS
- First iteration of MIPS architecture processor.
- Loads program, testfile.dat, into memories and successfuly executes each of the instructions by writing the value 7 to address 84. 

- Work in Progress: Multi-cycle MIPS processor and a pipelined iteration as the final project.
